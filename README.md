d# Hello, I am Pablo Cordero

**Full Stack Software Engineer & Creative Technologist** focused on building high-performance web applications where technical precision meets experimental design.

I architect interactive 3D interfaces, AI-driven cognitive systems, and robust full-stack applications using React, Django, and Three.js. I specialize in translating complex requirements into systematic UI architectures, supported by a disciplined, high-velocity workflow and over 3,000 GitHub contributions.

Complexity should serve the user—not the other way around. I build systems that feel crafted, intuitive, and easy to reason about.

## Featured Projects

**[NUMENEON](https://github.com/Cordero080/Numeneon-frontend)** — Co-Lead & System Architect
Neopunk social media platform; designed full-stack scaffolding, pseudocode, and task architecture for the team. River Timeline feed system. (807 clones in 6 days)

**[Pneuma](https://github.com/Cordero080/pneuma-ai)** — Pneuma — AI Personality Architecture
  Cognitive architecture built on Claude. 46 philosophical archetypes (Rumi,
  Borges, Jung, Feynman) dynamically selected via intent classification and
  forced into dialectical collision to produce non-scripted synthesis. Not a
  persona layer — a routing and synthesis system.

**[Nexus Geom Lab](https://github.com/Cordero080/nexus-geom-lab)** — 3D Geometry Visualization Platform
24 hyperdimensional geometries with GLSL shaders, progressive unlock system, and audio-reactive rendering. (380 clones)

**[Transcendence](https://github.com/Cordero080/Transcendence-3D-v2)** — 3D Evolution Simulator
Full Blender → FBX → Three.js pipeline with 32 custom animations, GLSL shaders, and hidden Battle Arena easter egg.

**[NUCAT](https://github.com/Cordero080/nucat)** — GPU Particle Systems  
Real-time ASCII point cloud renderer utilizing InstancedMesh and matrix-based skeleton sampling

**[DOJO](https://github.com/Cordero080/dojo-crud-app)** — A full-stack martial arts tracker built on authentic Okinawan Goju Ryu curriculum, featuring belt progression from 10th kyu to 8th dan with soft-delete recovery and rank-based analytics
