Hello, I am Pablo Cordero

**Full Stack Software Engineer & Creative Technologist** building at the intersection of experimental design and AI systems engineering.

I architect interactive 3D interfaces, AI-driven cognitive engines, and full-stack applications where aesthetics and engineering are inseparable. My work spans React, Django, Three.js, and OpenAI integrations — from Pneuma, a philosophical AI personality engine with 46 dialectical archetypes that generates emergent insight through ideological collision, to La Dolce Vita, a multilingual AI concierge that routes guest intent through keyword matching, live iCal availability, and GPT-4o-mini — intelligently, without burning tokens on questions that don't need them.
I don't just consume AI. I design the systems around it.

Most recently I led UI architecture on NUMENEON — a neopunk social platform with a signature River Timeline that reimagines how feeds handle information congestion. 3,000+ GitHub contributions. Disciplined, high-velocity workflow.
Complexity should serve the user — not the other way around.

## Featured Projects

**[NUMENEON](https://github.com/Cordero080/Numeneon-frontend)** — Co-Lead & System Architect
Neopunk social media platform; designed full-stack scaffolding, pseudocode, and task architecture for the team. River Timeline feed system. (807 clones in 6 days)

**[Pneuma](https://github.com/Cordero080/pneuma-ai)** — Pneuma — AI Personality Architecture
  Cognitive architecture built on Claude. 46 philosophical archetypes (Rumi,
  Borges, Jung, Feynman) dynamically selected via intent classification and
  forced into dialectical collision to produce non-scripted synthesis. Not a
  persona layer — a routing and synthesis system.

**[Nexus Geom Lab](https://github.com/Cordero080/nexus-geom-lab)** — 3D Geometry Visualization Platform
24 hyperdimensional geometries with GLSL shaders, progressive unlock system, and audio-reactive rendering. (380 clones)

**[Transcendence](https://github.com/Cordero080/Transcendence-3D-v2)** — 3D Evolution Simulator
Full Blender → FBX → Three.js pipeline with 32 custom animations, GLSL shaders, and hidden Battle Arena easter egg.

**[NUCAT](https://github.com/Cordero080/nucat)** — GPU Particle Systems  
Real-time ASCII point cloud renderer utilizing InstancedMesh and matrix-based skeleton sampling

**[DOJO](https://github.com/Cordero080/dojo-crud-app)** — A full-stack martial arts tracker built on authentic Okinawan Goju Ryu curriculum, featuring belt progression from 10th kyu to 8th dan with soft-delete recovery and rank-based analytics
