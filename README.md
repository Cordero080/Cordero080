# Hello, I am Pablo Cordero

**Full Stack Software Engineer & Creative Technologist** focused on building high-performance web applications where technical precision meets experimental design.

I architect interactive 3D interfaces, AI-driven cognitive systems, and robust full-stack applications using React, Django, and Three.js. I specialize in translating complex requirements into systematic UI architectures, supported by a disciplined, high-velocity workflow and over 3,000 GitHub contributions.

Complexity should serve the user—not the other way around. I build systems that feel crafted, intuitive, and easy to reason about.
